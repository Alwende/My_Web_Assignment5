# Introduction to JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Overview

This project is a basic web page demonstrating fundamental concepts of JavaScript and DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation. It fulfills the requirements of an introductory assignment focused on:

- Writing basic JavaScript functions.
- Dynamically manipulating the DOM.
- Responding to user interactions.

The page includes dynamic text changes, CSS style modifications through JavaScript, and the ability to add and remove list items using buttons.

## Features

- **Dynamic Text Content:** The initial text on the page is changed by JavaScript when the page loads.
- **Interactive Styling:** Clicking a button changes the background color of the page, the color of the main heading, and makes the dynamic text bold.
- **Adding List Items:** Clicking an "Add Item" button dynamically adds a new item to an unordered list.
- **Removing List Items:** Clicking a "Remove Item" button removes the last item from the unordered list.
- **Well-Structured HTML:** The project utilizes semantic HTML5 elements for a clear and organized structure.

## Getting Started

To view and interact with this project, simply follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone [Alwende](https://github.com/Alwende/My_Web_Assignment5)
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub details.)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

3.  **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.**

That's it! You should now be able to see the web page and interact with its features.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
-   `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for DOM manipulation and interactivity.
-   `style.css` (Optional): A CSS file for basic styling of the web page.

## Technologies Used

-   HTML5
-   CSS3 (Optional)
-   JavaScript

## Further Exploration

This project provides a basic introduction. Here are some ideas for further exploration:

-   Implement more complex styling changes.
-   Add different types of interactive elements.
-   Explore more advanced DOM manipulation techniques.
-   Learn about event delegation for more efficient event handling.
-   Consider how to fetch data from external sources and dynamically update the DOM.
